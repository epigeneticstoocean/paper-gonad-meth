# General DNA methylation patterns and environmentally-induced differential methylation in the eastern oyster (*Crassostrea virginica*)

## Background

Epigenetic modification, specifically DNA methylation, is one possible mechanism for transgenerational plasticity. Before inheritance of methylation patterns can be characterized we need a better understanding of how environmental change modifies the parental epigenome. Specifically, methylation patterns should be understood in reproductive tissue. We examined the effect of ocean acidification on Eastern oyster (*Crassostrea virginica*) reproductive tissue.

A total of 4,304,257 CpGs with at least 5x coverage summed across all ten samples were characterized. Loci were considered methylated if they were at least 50% methylated, sparsely methylated loci were 10-50% methylated, and unmethylated loci were 0-10% methylated. (b-g) Percent methylation globally and by sample across putative promoters, UTR, exons, introns, transposable elements, and intergenic regions. Global methylation (dark blue) was assessed using CpG loci with at least 5x coverage summed across all ten samples. Median percent methylation is plotted for each control (light blue) and treatment (green) sample.

All CpGs are every dinucleotide in the C. virginica genome. Methylated CpGs refers to a dinucleotide with a methylation level of at least 50%. (*code [here](https://github.com/epigeneticstoocean/paper-gonad-meth/blob/master/code/11-Proportion-Test.Rmd)*).

Samples in control pCO2 conditions are represented by grey, and samples in elevated pCO2 conditions are represented by a black bar. Loci with higher percent methylation are represented by darker colors. A logistic regression identified 598 DML, defined as individual CpG dinucleotide with at least a 50% methylation change between treatment and control groups, and a q-value < 0.01 based on correction for false discovery rate with the SLIM method. The density of DML at each percent methylation value is represented in the heatmap legend (*code [here](https://github.com/epigeneticstoocean/paper-gonad-meth/blob/master/code/04-methylkit.Rmd)*).

Methylation status of individual CpG loci explained 29.2% of variation between samples when considering all CpG loci. Methylation status of DML explained 57.1% of sample variation (*code [here](https://github.com/epigeneticstoocean/paper-gonad-meth/blob/master/code/04-methylkit.Rmd)*).

(a) Number of DML normalized by number of CpG in each chromosome (bars) and number of genes (line) in each C. virginica chromosome. (b) Counts of DML in genes containing DML. Most genes that contained DML only had 1 DML. (c) Proportion genes with different quantities of hyper- and hypomethylation DML. Genes with DML may have multiple DML, but these CpGs could be differentially methylated in opposite directions. For each number of DML in a gene, colors in the legend indicate the number of hypermethylated DML in that gene. The number of hypomethylated DML can be obtained by subtracting the number of hypermethylated DML from total DML in a gene.

The distribution of DML in C. virginica gonad tissue in response to ocean acidification differed from distribution of MBD-enriched loci with 5x coverage across control and treatment samples (Contingency test; Ï‡2  = 401.09, df = 6, P-value < 2.2e-16).

The scaled position of a DML within a gene was calculated by dividing the base pair position of the DML by gene length. Counts of hypermethylated DML are plotted above the x-axis, and hypomethylated DML counts are below the x-axis (*code [here](https://github.com/epigeneticstoocean/paper-gonad-meth/blob/master/code/13-DML-Characterization.Rmd)*).

Gene ontology categories with similar functions are represented by the same color. Genes may be involved in multiple biological processes. No gene ontologies were significantly enriched (*code [here](https://github.com/epigeneticstoocean/paper-gonad-meth/blob/master/code/14-Gene-Enrichment-with-GO-MWU.Rmd)*).
