Bismark report for: /gscratch/scrubbed/yaamini/data/Virginica-MBD/2018-10-17-Trimmed-Files//zr2096_2_s1_R1_val_1.fq.gz and /gscratch/scrubbed/yaamini/data/Virginica-MBD/2018-10-17-Trimmed-Files//zr2096_2_s1_R2_val_2.fq.gz (version: v0.19.0)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /gscratch/scrubbed/yaamini/data/Virginica-MBD/2018-04-27-Bismark-Inputs/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-1.2 -p 28 --reorder --ignore-quals --no-mixed --no-discordant --dovetail --maxins 500
Option '--non_directional' specified: alignments to all strands were being performed (OT, OB, CTOT, CTOB)

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequence pairs analysed in total:	30325606
Number of paired-end alignments with a unique best hit:	15247793
Mapping efficiency:	50.3% 
Sequence pairs with no alignments under any condition:	8686774
Sequence pairs did not map uniquely:	6391039
